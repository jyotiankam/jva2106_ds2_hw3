```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(warning = F)

```

Loading the library ISLR
```{r}

library(ISLR)

```

Viewing the Weekly dataset
```{r}

data(Weekly)
names(Weekly)
View(Weekly)


```

Let's use the summary() fuction to see the numerical summaries of the dataset

```{r}

summary(Weekly)

```

```{r}
cor(Weekly[,-9])
plot(Weekly$Volume)
pairs(Weekly)
```

As evident, all the Lags (1 to 5) have similar means and medians which implies that the return percentage has no correlation with time.
Also from the plots above, we can see that there is a correlation between Year and Volume - Volume increases as Year increases. Apart of these two variables, no other variables display any kind of relationship.
